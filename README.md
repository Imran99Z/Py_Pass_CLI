# Reflection; 
- While creating this program the most challenging part with figuring out what I wanted the code to do. Once I figured on a simple CLI interface my next biggest hurdle was configuring encryption with fernet, setting to master password. What was most challenging about this project were the modular imports, ensuring the vault key program worked. I found this to be a very exciting project putting my python knowledge to the test.
