# Reflection; 
While creating this program, the hardest part for me was figuring out exactly what I wanted the code to do. Once I decided on a simple CLI interface, my next challenge was setting up encryption with Fernet and connecting it properly to the master password system. The most tricky part was managing the modular imports and making sure the vault key and encryption worked properly across all files. Overall, I found this project really exciting it was a great way to put my Python skills to the test and see everything I learned come together in a functional program.
